<h2>Summary</h2>
<hr>
<p class="description">The Corleone family, one of the Five Families of the New York Mafia, fights the other four
    families in
    a brutal war
    in the years after World War II. After <a href="#vito">Don Vito Corleone</a> is shot by men working for drug kingpin
    <a href="#solo">Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo</a>, Corleone's two sons, <a href="#sonny">Santino (Sonny)</a> and <a
            href="#mich">Michael</a>, must run the family business with the help of
    consigliere <a href="#tom">Tom Hagen</a> and the family's two trusted caporegimes, <a href="#peter">Peter
        Clemenza</a> and
    <a href="#tess">Salvatore Tessio</a>. When Michael
    murders Sollozzo and his bodyguard, corrupt NYPD Captain <a href="#mark">Mark McCluskey</a>, while meeting with them
    in a restaurant,
    the conflict escalates into a full-scale war which results in Sonny's murder. Michael must return from hiding in
    Sicily to assume control of the family as the new Don. Under his retired father's tutelage, Michael orchestrates a
    plan to extract revenge, while relocating the Corleone family's power base to Las Vegas in order to further his goal
    of legitimizing the family and getting them out of organized crime. This encompasses the murder of all of the
    Corleone family's enemies, including Michael's brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi, who played a part in Sonny's murder.
    After selling all of the family's remaining businesses in New York, the Corleones permanently move to Las Vegas.

<p>The Corleone family patriarch is Vito Corleone (the Don), whose surname represents the Sicilian town of his birth,
    Corleone. His birth name is Vittorio Andolini, but after immigrating to the United States following the deaths of
    his parents and brother, he changed it to the name of his home village as one of his few acts of sentimentality.
    Vito fathered four children: Sonny Corleone, Fredo Corleone, Michael Corleone, and Connie Corleone. He also has an
    informally adopted Irish son, Tom Hagen, who became the Corleone family's consigliere (counselor). Vito Corleone is
    also godfather to the famous singer and movie star Johnny Fontane. The godfather referred to in the title is Vito,
    but the story's main character becomes Michael. The novel's central storyline details Michael's destiny to succeed
    his father as the head of the family empire, despite his desire to lead an Americanized life with his girlfriend
    (and eventual wife) Kay Adams.
    The Corleone family is a criminal organization with national influence, notably protection, gambling and union
    racketeering. Serving as the Don's underboss is his oldest son, Sonny. The operational side of the organization is
    headed by two caporegimes, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. Other significant members of the organization
    include Connie's abusive husband Carlo Rizzi and enforcers Luca Brasi and Al Neri.
