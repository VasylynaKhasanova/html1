<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Corleone family, one of the Five Families of the New York Mafia, fights the other four families in a brutal war
    in the years after World War II. After Don Vito Corleone is shot by men working for drug kingpin Virgil "The Turk"
    Sollozzo, Corleone's two sons, Santino (Sonny) and Michael, must run the family business with the help of
    consigliere Tom Hagen and the family's two trusted caporegimes, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. When Michael
    murders Sollozzo and his bodyguard, corrupt NYPD Captain Mark McCluskey, while meeting with them in a restaurant,
    the conflict escalates into a full-scale war which results in Sonny's murder. Michael must return from hiding in
    Sicily to assume control of the family as the new Don. Under his retired father's tutelage, Michael orchestrates a
    plan to extract revenge, while relocating the Corleone family's power base to Las Vegas in order to further his goal
    of legitimizing the family and getting them out of organized crime. This encompasses the murder of all of the
    Corleone family's enemies, including Michael's brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi, who played a part in Sonny's murder.
    After selling all of the family's remaining businesses in New York, the Corleones permanently move to Las Vegas.
